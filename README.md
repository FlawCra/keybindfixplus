# Keybind Fix Plus

This is a fork of [Keybind Fix](https://modrinth.com/mod/keybind-fix).

Keybind Fix Plus is a simple Fabric mod that aims to accomplish one major task: allowing for functional keybind conflicts.

In Minecraft, if two or more keybindings are set to the same conflicting key, the functionality of all but one keybinding is completely lost. For example, if you set both Jump and Strafe Left to the space bar, only the last of those functions that was set will work; you might strafe but not jump.

Keybind Fix Plus allows for mapping of multiple keybindings to the same key. Using the above example, with Keybind Fix Plus installed the player will both jump and strafe left.

This does NOT prevent all keybind conflicts. Two or more keybinds may still have incompatible functionality. If one keybind opens a door and another closes one, mapping both will still cause the underlying effects to fight (trying to open and close the door at the same time).
